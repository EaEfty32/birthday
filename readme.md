# Happy Birthday — For Hridi (vibrant & respectful)

A single-page static site to wish **Hridi Whrittika Das** a happy birthday — vibrant colors, light confetti, short letter, poem-flavored wishes.

## Quick start

1. **Edit content**: open `script.js` and adjust the `CONFIG` object (names, messages, images).
2. **(Optional) Audio**: place an instrumental MP3 you have rights to use in the repo and set `CONFIG.audioSrc` to its path.
3. **Deploy on Vercel**:
   - Push these files to a **public GitHub repo** (or drag-drop the folder in Vercel → New Project).
   - Framework preset: **Other** (Static).
   - No build command. Output directory: `/` (root).
   - Deploy.

## Local preview

Just open `index.html` in your browser.

## Notes

- Replace gallery URLs with your own images if you prefer.
- Set `metDate` like `"2021-07-15"` to display “days since we met”. Leave empty to hide.
